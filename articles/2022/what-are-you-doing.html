        <p>Communication plays a vital role in the workplace, especially in
today‚Äôs growing remote setup. Knowing what every team member is busy
with definitely helps managers be better at estimating the current
status and anticipating delivery. In fact, one of the most important
moments for every team is the daily standup.</p>
<p>With more and more managers leading transversal cross-functional
squads, with members working on different products, each with their own
ceremonies, it becomes more complex to conduct daily standups and to be
on top of what everyone is doing.</p>
<p>This creates a rather obscure environment where managers, not knowing
what exactly is going on with each direct report, tend to rely on
third-person feedback. With experience and practice, it‚Äôs of course
possible to have a pretty good picture of both outstanding and poor
performances relying mostly on this kind of feedback.</p>
<h2 id="working-in-the-dark">Working in the dark</h2>
<p>While managers can rely on indirect feedback, an extremely common
issue is that direct reports don‚Äôt have that many options to understand
what their manager is up to. This inevitably creates an obfuscated
environment where people don‚Äôt feel understood and where issues only
bubble up when it‚Äôs too late.</p>
<p>As managers we tend to work in bursts of effort, often interleaved
between each other as we are pulled in different directions. Because our
decisions affect directly and indirectly the people that we care for, we
tend to assume that everybody knows what we are doing at any given time.
This cannot be more wrong. We are totally absorbed by our current task
the same exact way our direct reports are.</p>
<p>Moreover, sometimes our tasks are particularly sensitive and we feel
the need to protect our reports from all the noise. Think about
situations such as acquisition or major re-organization. In such
scenarios it is easy to plow away and spend (too much) time away from
the teams.</p>
<h2 id="they-want-to-know">They want to know</h2>
<p><em>Why is it that you‚Äôre more distant lately? What‚Äôs going on in the
company? How‚Äôs that going to affect me? Can I help you?</em></p>
<p>These are just a few of the questions people have when you spend time
away from them. Less experienced managers often underestimate how their
actions influence others, thinking they are screening them for their
good without realizing they are instead just neglecting them.</p>
<p><strong>People appreciate when you are always present but really
notice when you are not there for them.</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-to-keep-them-informed">How to keep them informed</h2>
<p>More experienced leaders know this well. They resort to different
ways to keep their followers informed on what they are up to, about
their wins, and their losses. Some institute ad hoc meetings to inform
their reports about their work, while some others use existing aligners
or similar events. It very much depends on personal style and company
culture.</p>
<p>Depending on the number of reports, some leaders send a weekly email
in which they focus on the three main dimensions of their work: company,
team, and personal. Writing this kind of email is easier said than done.
Striking the right balance of information is almost an art. Too little
and you won‚Äôt be making sense, too much and people won‚Äôt read it.</p>
<p>However, as discussed in our previous article ‚Äú<a
href="/articles/2022/write-things-down.html">Write things down</a>‚Äù,
composing such an email will be of tremendous benefit, and not just for
yourself.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you come up with as
long as you keep people informed about what you are doing. People seek
information, they want to be in the know. As servant leaders, we have an
obligation to communicate clearly and openly our daily struggles
especially if we strive to build a culture in which we expect our
reports to share their struggles with us.</p>
<p>It requires discipline and exercise to hit the sweet spot in terms of
how much we should share, but in our job, we rarely encounter a more
powerful way to avoid ambiguity and misalignment.</p>
