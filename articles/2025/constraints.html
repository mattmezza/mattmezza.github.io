          <h4 class="!mt-4 !font-normal">8th October 2025 &middot; Matteo Merola</h4>
        </header>
        <p>As an Engineering Manager, one of the most common questions I get is,
“How can I grow?”, or “How do I become better at what I do?”. These are
big questions, and there’s no single magic answer. However, throughout
my career, I’ve consistently observed one powerful, often
counter-intuitive principle that helps: <strong>the intentional
application of constraints.</strong></p>
<p>We often view constraints as limitations, obstacles that prevent us
from achieving our goals. But what if we flipped that perspective? What
if well-chosen constraints became catalysts for innovation, efficiency,
and ultimately, greater impact?</p>
<h3 id="why-constraints-drive-growth">Why Constraints Drive Growth</h3>
<p>The core idea is simple: when you limit a resource – be it time,
tools, or budget – without lowering your output expectations, you
<em>force</em> yourself to find better, more efficient ways of working.
You move beyond established habits and comfort zones, sparking
creativity and problem-solving.</p>
<p>This isn’t about working harder; it’s about working smarter (beware:
finding out the way to work smarter most certainly entails working
harder for a good while!). In the short term, the goal is to maintain
your current productivity with the new constraint. In the long term, the
refined processes and newfound efficiencies will significantly boost
your overall output and impact. It’s a forcing function for
optimization.</p>
<h3 id="practical-examples-of-self-imposed-constraints">Practical
Examples of Self-Imposed Constraints</h3>
<p>Let’s look at a few ways you can apply this principle, from broad
habits to specific technical challenges.</p>
<h4 id="constraining-your-working-hours">Constraining Your Working
Hours</h4>
<p>If work-life balance is a priority, commit to a strict 9-to-5
workday. No exceptions, no late-night emails. Initially, this might feel
suffocating. But this constraint forces you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prioritize ruthlessly.</strong> Is this task <em>really</em>
the most important thing you could be doing?</li>
<li><strong>Delegate more effectively.</strong> You can’t do it all, so
you learn to trust others.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize distractions.</strong> Every minute counts, so you
become allergic to time-wasters.</li>
<li><strong>Run fewer, better meetings.</strong> An hour-long meeting
suddenly feels incredibly expensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll quickly discover inefficiencies you previously tolerated. The
goal isn’t to work less, it’s to achieve the same or more in a focused,
constrained window.</p>
<h4 id="constraining-your-operating-environment">Constraining Your
Operating Environment</h4>
<p>For those who value a minimalist, distraction-free workspace,
consider, as an example, stripping down your operating system. My
personal journey led me to Arch Linux without a desktop environment, as
detailed in my <a
href="https://github.com/mattmezza/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>. While
seemingly extreme, this constraint:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eliminated bloat</strong> and resource-hungry background
processes.</li>
<li><strong>Forced me to deeply understand my tools</strong> and
workflows, from the shell to my editor.</li>
<li><strong>Required me to build an environment tailored precisely to my
needs,</strong> where every tool serves a purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had to give up some conveniences, but the result is an incredibly
lean, fast, and productive environment that translates directly into
more deliberate work.</p>
<h4 id="constraining-your-toolset-and-dependencies">Constraining Your
Toolset and Dependencies</h4>
<p>This can be a powerful driver for technical growth. On your next
project, try one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No new dependencies.</strong> Force yourself to solve a
problem using only the libraries already in the project. This deepens
your understanding of your existing stack and prevents software
bloat.</li>
<li><strong>Vanilla JS, not a framework.</strong> Building a small
feature with plain JavaScript instead of reaching for React or Vue will
solidify your understanding of the fundamentals of the web.</li>
<li><strong>Use a “dumber” tool.</strong> Instead of a full-fledged IDE,
try a simpler text editor for a while. It forces you to learn the
command line, understand your build tools, and rely on your own
knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="constraining-your-communication">Constraining Your
Communication</h4>
<p>For one week, default to asynchronous communication. Ban yourself
from using Slack for anything that isn’t a true emergency. This forces
you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write clearer, more thoughtful messages.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Document decisions properly</strong> in places like design
docs or closer to source code.</li>
<li><strong>Respect your colleagues’ focus time.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It will quickly reveal which meetings could have been an email and
which conversations are just noise.</p>
<h3 id="crucial-considerations-for-setting-constraints">Crucial
Considerations for Setting Constraints</h3>
<p>Applying constraints effectively isn’t about blind restriction; it
requires thought and strategy.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The Goal is Not Lower Output.</strong> I can’t stress this
enough. The primary objective is to maintain or increase productivity
under the new conditions. A constraint is a tool for optimization, not
an excuse for delivering less.</li>
<li><strong>Choose Wisely – Avoid Unrealistic Constraints.</strong>
Setting impossible constraints will only lead to frustration, burnout,
and a quick retreat to your comfort zone. Start small, make gradual
changes, and ensure the constraint is <em>just</em> challenging enough
to push you. Pondered and informed constraint setting is key.</li>
<li><strong>Allow Ample Time for Evaluation.</strong> Don’t expect
immediate results. Give yourself a proper time window – weeks or even a
few months – to adapt and evaluate. A common pitfall is abandoning a
constraint too soon, before its benefits have a chance to
materialize.</li>
<li><strong>Measure Your Progress.</strong> You can’t know if a
constraint is working if you don’t have a baseline. Before you start,
take note of key metrics. Re-evaluate after the trial period. Data helps
you distinguish between “this feels uncomfortable” and “this is hurting
my performance.”</li>
<li><strong>Know When to Quit (or Iterate).</strong> A good constraint
is a productive challenge, not a source of misery. Define your “escape
hatch.” If a constraint is causing a sustained drop in critical output
or undue stress, don’t be afraid to abandon or modify it. Maybe a strict
9-5 is too rigid, but a “no work after 7 PM” rule is the perfect
fit.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace the Discomfort.</strong> It will feel weird and
inefficient at first. That feeling of friction is the signal that you’re
pushing against old habits. Lean into it. Differentiate between
productive discomfort and genuine pain. The first is a sign of growth;
the second is a sign to re-evaluate.</li>
</ol>
<p>By intentionally imposing constraints, you’re not limiting yourself;
you’re creating the conditions for profound growth and unlocking new
levels of performance and creativity. It’s an uncomfortable journey, but
one that consistently yields significant rewards.</p>
