        </header>
        <p>Hiring is one of the most critical things we do as engineering
leaders. It‚Äôs also one of the hardest to get right. Over the years, I‚Äôve
hired a couple of hundred engineers, and I‚Äôve iterated constantly on my
process. My goal is simple: make it fast enough to not lose great
candidates, and robust enough to yield good results.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve all been in those endless hiring loops. Multiple rounds,
panels, and long debrief meetings where the loudest voice often wins. I
found that a lengthy process doesn‚Äôt correlate with a higher quality of
hire. It just correlates with a higher chance of your top candidate
accepting another offer.</p>
<p>Engineers want to have a say in who joins their team, but they are
rightfully focused on their work. Being mindful of their time is
paramount. This led me to develop a lightweight yet powerful feedback
collection method that has become the cornerstone of my hiring strategy.
I call it the <code>+-=?:</code> format.</p>
<h3 id="the-process-in-a-nutshell">The Process in a Nutshell</h3>
<p>My interview process is trimmed down to the essentials:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Hiring Manager Interview:</strong> I conduct this first.
It‚Äôs my chance to assess alignment on values, ambition, and high-level
experience. It‚Äôs a chance for the candidate to understand what the hell
we are working on and learn about the company‚Äôs business.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Assessment:</strong> A pair of engineers
(sometimes a trio) from the team takes the candidate through a technical
discussion. This is their domain.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback Collection:</strong> After the technical
assessment, each interviewer sends me their feedback in a structured
format.</li>
<li><strong>Decision Making:</strong> I review the feedback, look for
patterns, and make a decision. If there are conflicting opinions, I
follow up with the interviewers to understand their perspectives
better.</li>
</ol>
<p>The magic happens right after the technical assessment. Instead of a
group debrief, which can be swayed by groupthink, I ask each interviewer
to send me their feedback as a direct message. This forces individual
assessment and prevents bias.</p>
<h3 id="the---feedback-framework">The <code>+-=?:</code> Feedback
Framework</h3>
<p>The feedback comes in a simple, structured text format. It‚Äôs easy to
write and, more importantly, easy to parse. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+</code> <strong>Positives:</strong> What were the candidate‚Äôs
clear strengths? What did you like?</li>
<li><code>-</code> <strong>Negatives:</strong> What were the red flags
or clear areas of weakness?</li>
<li><code>=</code> <strong>On-the-fence:</strong> Points that could be
good or bad depending on context, or things that simply felt ‚Äúoff‚Äù to
the interviewer.</li>
<li><code>?</code> <strong>Doubts:</strong> What questions are still
unanswered? What do you wish you had more time to explore?</li>
<li><code>:</code> <strong>Recommendation:</strong> The final call, with
a one-line justification. The scale is:
<code>dont-hire | hire-but | hire | hire-now</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here‚Äôs a real-world example of what I might receive from an
interviewer:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>+ experience with both frontend and backend
+ experience with the same industry
- little experience with react (mostly angular)
= very much into &quot;agile&quot; and &quot;scrum&quot;
? although has exp with frontend and backend I could not grasp the depth of exp in distributed microservice setups

: hire-now : I would love working with this person, they seem nice and can bring plenty of exp to our team</code></pre>
<h3 id="why-this-framework-works">Why This Framework Works</h3>
<p>After I receive a couple of these from the interviewers, I almost
always have a clear picture. The benefits have proven to be
significant:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>It Minimizes Unconscious Bias:</strong> By having
interviewers provide feedback independently, I eliminate the risk of one
person‚Äôs opinion influencing the entire group before the discussion even
starts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It Maximizes Signal, Minimizes Time:</strong> Engineers
don‚Äôt need to write an essay. They just need to fill the template. This
structure gives them clear buckets to think about during the interview
itself. The whole process is incredibly respectful of their
time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It Gives Interviewers Freedom:</strong> I don‚Äôt dictate
how the engineers should run their technical sessions. So long as they
come away with enough signal to fill out the <code>+-=?:</code>
feedback, they can drive the conversation in the way that feels most
authentic to them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It Surfaces Misalignment for Calibration:</strong> What
happens when I get one <code>:hire-now</code> and one
<code>:dont-hire</code>? This is a gift. It‚Äôs a clear signal that the
interviewers are not calibrated. It gives me a perfect, data-driven
reason to bring them together and discuss their conflicting viewpoints.
These calibration sessions are far more valuable than a generic
debrief.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It Allows for Feedback Weighing:</strong> Sometimes I‚Äôll
have a less experienced engineer shadow an interview for training. Their
feedback is valuable, but I can weigh it differently against the
feedback from a tenured senior engineer. The raw text format makes this
implicit weighting easy.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="its-a-framework-not-a-cage">It‚Äôs a Framework, Not a Cage</h3>
<p>A common question I get is whether this simple format loses valuable
nuance. Like any tool, its effectiveness depends on how you use it.
Here‚Äôs how we address potential pitfalls:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>On Losing Context:</strong> The <code>+-=?:</code>
message is the start of the feedback process, not the end. Its purpose
is to get a clean, unbiased initial read. If I see an intriguing comment
in the <code>=</code> or <code>?</code> sections, I‚Äôll follow up with
that interviewer 1-on-1 to get the richer story behind the
summary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>On Candidate Experience:</strong> The ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù for
interviewers isn‚Äôt a free-for-all. It exists within firm guardrails. As
a hiring manager, I set clear expectations for the tone, goals, and
rules of engagement for all interviews. We aim for a process that is
respectful and consistent for the candidate, even if the exact technical
topics vary. The speed of this process is, in itself, a huge plus for
the candidate experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>On Hidden Biases:</strong> Individual biases can still
exist. The framework helps by making them more visible. If an
interviewer lists something like <code>"= very much into 'agile'"</code>
as a neutral point, it‚Äôs a flag for me to ask <em>why</em>. This allows
me to challenge assumptions and ensure we‚Äôre judging skills, not
personal preferences. It turns a potential hidden bias into a coachable
moment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>On Training Junior Interviewers:</strong> The framework
is an excellent training tool. When joining the interviews, I always
pair a junior interviewer with a senior one. After the interview, they
can discuss what they observed before sending me their individual
feedback. I can then compare their reports to see how the junior
interviewer is progressing in their ability to spot key
signals.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Hiring will always be an imperfect science. The context
matters‚Äîhiring a full-time employee is different from bringing on a
fixed-term consultant. But the principles of respecting time,
structuring feedback, and mitigating bias are universal.</p>
<p>YOLO hiring doesn‚Äôt work, and outsourced recruitment doesn‚Äôt always
have the team‚Äôs best interests at heart. Building a great team requires
a thoughtful process. This framework is my way of making it quick,
robust, and engineer-friendly.</p>
